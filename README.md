### About
MarketFinder is a web app that helps users easily access detailed information about their local farmers markets. I love to shop at different farmers markets, but I’ve always found it difficult to figure out if a certain market will have the type of foods I’m looking for—or if it’s even currently open for the season. In addition, many people are simply unsure where to find the closest markets and are unaware of all the different products they have to offer. So, I created MarketFinder to streamline the farmers market experience and to encourage people to shop local.

### How to use
After searching for an area you want to explore, you’ll be able to interactively visualize the closest farmers markets nearby, view details about the products they offer, and see which months they’ll be in season for. Check it out here: [MarketFinder](https://marketfinder.netlify.app)

### Why Farmers Markets?
The fruits and veggies you buy at the farmers market are the freshest available. They’re brought directly to you: no long-distance shipping, no artificial ripening, and no sitting for weeks in storage.

They also contribute to protecting the environment. Food in the U.S. travels an average of 1,500 miles to get to your plate. Cutting down on this shipping saves large amounts of natural resources, lowers pollution levels, and reduces trash from excess packaging.

Finally, shopping at farmers markets makes a big impact on family farmers. Now more than ever, small family farms have a hard time competing in the food marketplace. Buying directly from farmers gives them a better return for their produce and is a great way to support your community.

### Technology
MarketFinder is built with React ([create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)). Mapping capabilities are provided by [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), and detailed farmers market data is sourced from the USDA Farmers Market Directory API. React-Bootstrap is used for styling and Netlify for hosting.
